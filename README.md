Project Orange Fox
================

An alarm clock application built on the Universal Windows Platform for Windows Phone 10
==========================================================================================

Project Orange Fox (POF)
POF is a learning project that's still in progress and is an analogue of the Windows Phone 10 Alarm Clock. The project's UI is very similar to the original program although it will differ in functionality. Finished product features will exclude "World Clock", "Timer", "Stopwatch" and will purely work as a simple alarm program, although this is not a final decision and missing features might be added later. POF main features will give users these options:

* create multiple alarms
* set alarm description
* set time to invoke alarm
* select repeat cycle for each day alarm is needed
* toggle the enabled state of saved alarms
* preview and select sounds from available collection of ringtones  or user's choice custom sound
* preview and select a challenge that needs to be solved in order to snooze or dismiss the alarm

POF will have small collection of easy-to-solve game-puzzles user can preview and select from. Games will need to be solved before the alarm can be dismissed or snoozed. These snooze challenges aren't mandatory and a "None" option will be provided. The Idea of solving a puzzle to snooze/disable the alarm is not unique and proved to be popular in other phone's OS.
Cortana integration is on the wish list but has not been investigated yet.

## Motivation
I started Project Orange Fox (release name TBC) to gain knowledge about software development, C# programming language and XAML. My main goal is to make the application work and practically use the concepts that I study. Recreating designs from existing applications helps me spend more time on making application features work and so learning the how. Also helping myself and hopefully future users of this exciting program to make mornings easier to wake up to, or at least harder to snooze away.


## Installation
